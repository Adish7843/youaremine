                    I am writing this to tell you that I love you so much. You are my first thought in the morning and I hold you in my last breath in the evening. I need you more and more each day like an addiction of some sort, an addiction to love you more and more each day I guess. You fixed me when I broke and you took my pain away. You listened when I cried and you stood right there when I laughed, but most importantly you never let me goâ€”No matter how hard I tried at first to not fall in love and push you away sometimes, but you still stayed and that is something I will never be able to forget.
                    <br><br>
                    And when I say I love you more, I don't just mean I love you more than you love me. I mean I love you more than the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have, I love you more than the distance between us, I love you more than anything that would try and come between us. I LOVE YOU THE MOST ADEENA. This is my love letter.
